# Open–closed principle
Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification. In more simple words you can always add new code to an object, but you should never change the design of old code.

It is much better to work with **dependencies**, meaning passing an object to another object as a parameter. 

Ideal code should be written with the **Blackbox** principle in mind, you should be able to guess what a function does just looking at its signature.

Consider how the coupling of two entities affects their respective maintainability. The more a given entity knows about how another one is implemented, the more we can say that they are coupled. Therefore, if one of the two entities is changed, then the other must be changed too.

## Your mission
Look at the old.ts file, and you see a bunch of animals in a zoo, all making the sounds.
Now add another animal (you can choose your favorite animal), and make sure it makes a sound.

Did you notice you needed to alter the Zoo object even when all you did was add a new Animal class? Would it not be much better to move the `makeSound` function to each Animal class, so each animal can decide for himself what sound he makes instead of the Zoo class?

Create a `makeSound` function to each Animal class and remove the giant switch from the Zoo class. Now you can easily add new animals without altering an existing class!
